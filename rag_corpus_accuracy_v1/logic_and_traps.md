# Logic and language traps

Contrapositive basics
- If a statement is "healthy implies green", the contrapositive is "not green implies not healthy".
- The converse "green implies healthy" is not guaranteed by the original statement.

Language traps
- "If you have 3 apples and you take away 2, how many apples do you have?" means you have 2.
- "Sells all but 4" means 4 remain.
