# RAG accuracy corpus v1

Purpose: a small, stable corpus that improves accuracyMode results for knowledge retrieval and language trap prompts.

Keep stable:
- Do not edit facts between runs unless you want to test drift.
- Keep the corpus small (a few pages total) for deterministic retrieval.

Files
- facts_and_constants.md
- units_and_percent.md
- logic_and_traps.md
